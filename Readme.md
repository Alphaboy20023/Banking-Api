## OVERVIEW
BankingAPI is a robust and scalable backend application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a modern banking system. It provides a secure and efficient platform for handling user authentication, account creation, fund transfers, and transaction history management. Built with a focus on security, modularity, and performance, BankingAPI demonstrates the application of RESTful API principles, JWT-based authentication, and data integrity enforcement through validation and structured domain models.

This project is ideal for showcasing enterprise-grade backend development practices, including layered architecture, dependency injection, and token-based session management — all within a clean and extensible Spring Boot framework.

## KEY FEATURES:

- User Authentication & Authorization: Secure registration, login, and JWT-based session handling.

- Account Management: Create and manage multiple user accounts with unique identifiers.

- Fund Transfers: Perform peer-to-peer transfers between user accounts with real-time balance updates.

- Transaction History: Retrieve detailed transaction records for accountability and tracking.

- Modular Architecture: Service, Repository, and Controller layers for maintainability and scalability.

- Robust Validation: Input validation and structured error handling for safe API interaction.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Security (JWT-based authentication)
- Hibernate / JPA
- H2 database
- Maven

3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. API runs on http://localhost:8080


## Authentication & Authorization
BankingAPI implements a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system to ensure secure access control across all protected routes.

Every request made to sensitive endpoints—such as account management, fund transfers, and card operations—must include a valid JWT token in the request header.

The system enforces role-based authorization, distinguishing between regular users and administrators to maintain data privacy and operational integrity.

Authentication Flow
- A new user registers via POST /api/users.
- The user logs in using POST /api/users/login, providing valid credentials.
- Upon successful authentication, the server issues a JWT token signed with a secret key.
- This token must accompany all subsequent requests in the Authorization header.

Example header:
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

Roles & Access Control
Role        Permissions    
**USER**    Can view, update, and manage their own account, perform transfers,  and view personal transactions. 

**ADMIN**   Full system access — including managing users, viewing all transactions, and deleting records. 

# Token Lifecycle
- Tokens are time-bound and will expire after a configured duration (defined in your JWT settings).
- Expired or invalid tokens automatically return a 401 UNAUTHORIZED response.
- Role violations return a 403 FORBIDDEN response.

Response Examples
# Successful Login
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

# ❌ Unauthorized Access
{
  "error": "Access denied. Invalid or missing token."
}

## API Usage Instructions
The BankingAPI exposes a RESTful interface for secure and efficient interaction between clients and the server.
`api/accounts`, `api/transactions` and `api/cards` are protected based on user roles and authentication state, while `api/users` endpoint does not require a token — it validates the user’s credentials and returns a simulated login response.

# Testing with Postman
- Open Postman and set the base URL to http://localhost:8080.
- Create a POST request for /api/users/login.
- Copy the JWT token from the response.
- Under the “Authorization” tab, select Bearer Token and paste the token.
- Test other secured endpoints like /api/accounts/transfer or /api/users/email/{email}.
